                Angela is constantly expanding her knowledge in the healing aspects of life. “I wish to help others <br>
                to heal and to help them to learn to heal themselves.” <br><br>
                Angela has been trained and certified in the wonderful knowledge of energy healing as a reiki master 
                teacher, angelic healing practitioner, certified massage therapist and a soul regression therapist. She 
                is self taught in tarot and oracle card reading and has been reading on and off for the past 10 
                years. <br><br> This is such an amazing time that we live in and she is so excited to be a part of it 
                and to be able to help others and spread the knowledge that she has learned so that they can in turn 
                hopefully go out and do the same with others.
